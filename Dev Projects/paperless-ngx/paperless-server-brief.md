# 🧾 Paperless-ngx Server Deployment Brief

## 1. Server Operating System

- **Distribution**: Debian 11 (Bullseye)
- **Installation Method**: Offline/DVD-based setup with manual package resolution
- **System Tuning**:
  - Optimized swap and resource allocation
  - Clean folder structure for maintainability
  - Privilege isolation for service accounts

## 2. Paperless-ngx Application Deployment

- **Installation Type**: Manual (non-Docker)
- **Components**:
  - **Gunicorn**: WSGI server running Paperless
  - **Redis**: Message broker (socket-only, password-protected)
  - **PostgreSQL**: Database (socket-only, peer-authenticated)
  - **Nginx**: Reverse proxy handling HTTPS and HTTP redirection
- **Python Environment**:
  - Located at `/opt/paperless/.local`
  - Created using `python3 -m venv`
  - Isolated from system Python packages
  - Activated via `source /opt/paperless/.local/bin/activate`

## 3. Implementation Details

- **Folder Structure**:
  - `/opt/paperless`: Application root
  - `/opt/paperless/consumption`: Input folder (shared via Samba)
  - `/opt/paperless/media`: Document storage
- **Systemd Services**:
  - `paperless-web.service`: Gunicorn via Unix socket
  - `redis.service`, `postgresql.service`: Hardened and isolated
- **Environment Configuration**:
  - `.env` file with socket paths and credentials
  - Redis and PostgreSQL accessed via Unix sockets only

## 4. Optional Enhancements

### Samba Share
- Configured to share `/opt/paperless/consumption` folder
- Accessible to LAN devices for easy document ingestion
- Permissions restricted to Paperless service account

### ImageMagick PDF Support
- Enabled PDF processing by modifying `/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml`
- Allows direct thumbnail generation from PDFs
- Falls back to Ghostscript only if needed

### jbig2enc Encoder
- Compiled from source and installed manually
- Reduces size of generated PDFs via JBIG2 compression
- Used during OCR post-processing

### NLTK Data
- Downloaded Snowball Stemmer, Stopwords, and Punkt tokenizer
- Stored in `/usr/share/nltk_data`
- Enables machine learning features for document classification and tagging

## 5. Security Hardening Measures

### Redis
- Bound to Unix socket only
- Password authentication enabled
- Socket permissions restricted to Paperless service account

### PostgreSQL
- Bound to Unix socket only
- Peer authentication for `paperless` Linux user
- Access restricted via `pg_hba.conf`

### Gunicorn
- Bound to Unix socket only
- Managed via systemd with sandboxing options

### Nginx
- Handles HTTPS via Let's Encrypt
- Redirects HTTP to HTTPS
- Proxies securely to Gunicorn socket

### System User Isolation
- `paperless` user has no shell access
- No password or SSH access permitted

### Systemd Sandboxing
- `ProtectSystem`, `PrivateTmp`, `NoNewPrivileges`
- Resource limits applied (`MemoryMax`, `CPUQuota`)

### Firewall Rules
- Only ports 22, 80, and 443 allowed
- Redis and PostgreSQL TCP ports blocked

### Fail2Ban
- Monitors Nginx logs for brute-force attempts
- Automatically bans suspicious IPs

### Audit Logging
- Enabled via `auditd` for file access and system events
- Logs rotated and managed securely

### Logrotate
- Configured for Paperless logs and system services
- Prevents log overflow and ensures retention
