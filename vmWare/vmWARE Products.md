-   Uses industry-standard x86 servers, eliminating the need for traditional storage arrays.

2.      **Storage Policy-Based Management (SPBM)**:

-   Allows you to define and apply storage policies at the VM level.
-   Policies dictate performance, availability, and other characteristics, which are automatically enforced by vSAN.

3.      **Scale-Out Architecture**:

-   Supports the addition of nodes to increase capacity and performance linearly.
-   Seamless scaling without disruption to operations.

4.      **High Availability and Resiliency**:

-   Data is mirrored across multiple hosts to ensure availability and protect against hardware failures.
-   Supports features like stretched clusters for site-level disaster recovery.

5.      **Deduplication and Compression**:

-   Reduces storage footprint by eliminating duplicate data and compressing data before writing it to disk.
-   Provides space efficiency and reduces storage costs.

6.      **Erasure Coding**:

-   Offers RAID-5/6-like protection to reduce the storage overhead compared to mirroring.
-   Provides data protection with less capacity overhead.

7.      **All-Flash and Hybrid Configurations**:

-   Supports all-flash configurations for high performance.
-   Also supports hybrid configurations with a mix of SSDs (for cache) and HDDs (for capacity).

8.      **Integration with VMware Ecosystem**:

-   Fully integrated with VMware vSphere, vCenter Server, and other VMware products.
-   Supports VMware tools like vMotion, HA, and DRS.

9.      **Cloud-Native Storage**:

VMware vSAN is a powerful solution for organizations looking to simplify their storage infrastructure, improve performance, and reduce costs, especially in virtualized environments.

## Will adding an eSXI node into vSAN delete its currently running VMs

Adding an ESXi node to a vSAN cluster does not inherently delete its currently running VMs, but there are some important considerations and steps you need to follow to ensure a smooth integration:

1.      **Compatibility and Preparation**:

-   Ensure the ESXi version on the new node is compatible with the vSAN cluster.
-   Verify that the hardware and configuration of the new node meet the vSAN requirements.

2.      **Configuration Steps**:

-   Add the ESXi host to the vCenter Server managing the vSAN cluster.
-   Make sure the network configuration (vSAN network) on the new node matches the existing vSAN network settings.

3.      **Maintenance Mode**:

-   Before adding the new node to the vSAN cluster, you might need to place it in maintenance mode, especially if you plan to configure or reconfigure storage devices for vSAN use.
-   If VMs are running on the host, you can migrate them to other hosts in the cluster using vMotion to avoid downtime.

4.      **Disk Configuration**:

-   If the new node's disks are to be added to the vSAN datastore, you'll need to claim them for vSAN. This process typically involves configuring the disk groups on the new node.
-   Claiming disks for vSAN should be done carefully, as this process will format the disks for vSAN use, which will erase any existing data on those disks.

### Steps to Add a New Node to a vSAN Cluster

1.      **Add the Host to vCenter**:

-   [ ] Connect the new ESXi host to the vCenter Server that manages the vSAN cluster.

2.      **Configure Network**:

-   [ ] Ensure the vSAN network is configured correctly on the new host, matching the existing vSAN network configuration.

3.      **Place Host in Maintenance Mode** (if needed):

-   [ ] If you need to configure storage devices or if there are running VMs, place the host in maintenance mode and migrate VMs as necessary.

4.      **Add Host to vSAN Cluster**:

-   [ ] Add the ESXi host to the vSAN cluster through the vCenter interface.

5.      **Configure Disk Groups**:

-   [ ] Claim the disks on the new host for vSAN. This will involve creating disk groups and specifying which disks to use for cache and capacity.
-   [ ] Be aware that claiming disks will format them, erasing any existing data.

6.      **Monitor the Cluster**:

-   [ ] Once the node is added and disk groups are configured, monitor the vSAN cluster for health and performance to ensure the new node is integrated successfully.

By following these steps and considerations, you can add an ESXi node to a vSAN cluster without losing the VMs running on that host, as long as you handle the storage configuration properly and migrate any active VMs before making changes to the storage setup.
