Ethernet Address of ESXI via SSH

To find the Ethernet (MAC) address of an ESXi host via SSH, you can use the following steps:

1.      **Connect to ESXi Host via SSH:**

-   Use an SSH client (like PuTTY) to connect to your ESXi host.
-   Log in with your credentials.

2.      **Run the** `**esxcli**` **Command:**

-   Once logged in, you can use the `esxcli` command to find the network interface details, including the MAC address. The command is:

```plaintext
esxcli network nic list
```

3.      **Review the Output:**

-   The output will list all network interfaces with details including the MAC address. The output typically looks like this:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | PCI | Device Driver | Link | Speed | Duplex | MAC Address | MTU | Description |
| vmnic0 | 0000:00:19.0 | e1000e | Up  | 1000 | Full | 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E | 1500 | Intel Corporation I350 Gigabit Network Connection |

In this example, the MAC address for `vmnic0` is `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.

# ESXI Host Management Network

To identify the MAC address of the ESXi host's management network specifically, follow these steps after connecting via SSH:

### 1.      **Run the** `**esxcli**` **Command for Management Network:**

```plaintext
esxcli network ip interface list
```

### 2.      **Review the Output:**

-   The output will provide details about the network interfaces, including their association with the management network. It will look something like this:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | IPv4 Address | IPv4 Netmask | IPv4 Broadcast  Address | MAC Address | MTU |
| vmk0 | 192.168.0.10 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.0.255 | 00:50:56:aa:bb:cc | 1500 |

### 3.      **Identify the Management Network Interface:**

-   The management network interface is typically `vmk0`. Look for the interface that has the IP address you use to manage your ESXi host.
-   The MAC address listed for `vmk0` (or your management network interface) is the one you are looking for.

Putting it together, run the commands and look for `vmk0` or the interface associated with your management network:

```plaintext
esxcli network ip interface list
```

This will show the interface details including the MAC address. For example:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | IPv4 Address | IPv4 Netmask | IPv4 Broadcast  Address | MAC Address | MTU |
| vmk0 | 192.168.0.10 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.0.255 | 00:50:56:aa:bb:cc | 1500 |

In this example, `vmk0` is the management network interface, and its MAC address is `00:50:56:aa:bb:cc`.

Yes, the MAC address associated with the management network interface (commonly `vmk0`) is used by the ESXi operating system for management purposes. This is the address you would typically need for network-related configurations or for setting up permissions and access controls related to your ESXi host.

## Detailed Breakdown

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1.      **Management Network Interface (vmk0)**: This is the virtual NIC that the ESXi host uses for management traffic, including communication with vSphere Client, SSH, and other management tools.

2.      **MAC Address for Management Interface**: The MAC address for `vmk0` (or the interface you use for management) is assigned by the ESXi operating system. This is the address you see when you run the `esxcli network ip interface list` command.

To confirm and gather the details:

1.      **Connect to ESXi Host via SSH**:

-   Use an SSH client (like PuTTY) to connect to your ESXi host.
-   Log in with your credentials.

2.      **Run the Command**:

-   `esxcli network ip interface list`

3.      **Review the Output**:

-   Look for `vmk0` or the interface designated for management.
-   Note the MAC address listed for that interface.

### Example Output:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | IPv4 Address | IPv4 Netmask | IPv4 Broadcast  Address | MAC Address | MTU |
| vmk0 | 192.168.0.10 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.0.255 | 00:50:56:aa:bb:cc | 1500 |

In this example, `00:50:56:aa:bb:cc` is the MAC address used by the ESXi host for its management network. This is the address taken up and used by the ESXi operating system for management purposes.

# DHCP for VMs in ESXi

To set up DHCP for VMs in ESXi, you need to ensure that your VMs can obtain IP addresses from a DHCP server. This can be done in two main ways:

1.  **Using an External DHCP Server**: This is a DHCP server running on another machine or device in your network, such as a router or dedicated DHCP server.
2.  **Using a Virtual DHCP Server**: This is a DHCP server running on a VM within the ESXi environment.

## Option 1: Using an External DHCP Server

If you have a DHCP server already running on your network, follow these steps:

1.  **Ensure Network Configuration Allows DHCP**:
    -   Make sure your ESXi host and the VMs are connected to a network segment that has access to the DHCP server.
    -   This usually means that the VM's network adapter should be connected to a virtual switch that is bridged to the physical network with DHCP access.
2.  **Configure VM Network Adapter**:
    -   Edit the settings of your VM.
    -   Under the "Network Adapter" settings, ensure the adapter is connected to the correct network (a port group on a virtual switch with access to the DHCP server).
3.  **Set VM to Use DHCP**:
    -   Within the guest operating system of the VM, configure the network settings to obtain an IP address automatically (using DHCP).

## Option 2: Using a Virtual DHCP Server

If you want to run a DHCP server within your ESXi environment, you can set up a VM to act as a DHCP server. Here’s how:

1.  **Create a DHCP Server VM**:
    -   Deploy a new VM with an operating system that can run a DHCP server (such as Linux or Windows Server).
2.  **Install and Configure DHCP Server Software**:
    1.  **For Linux**:
        1.  Install a DHCP server package. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use `isc-dhcp-server`:
            -   `sudo apt updatesudo apt install isc-dhcp-server`
        2.  Configure the DHCP server by editing the configuration file (`/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`). Add the necessary subnet and range configurations.
        3.  Start and enable the DHCP server service:
            -   `sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-serversudo systemctl enable isc-dhcp-server`
    2.  **For Windows Server**:
        1.  Install the DHCP Server role through the Server Manager.
        2.  Configure the DHCP server with the necessary scopes and options.
3.  **Ensure Network Configuration**:
    -   Make sure the VM running the DHCP server is connected to the correct network (a port group on a virtual switch) where other VMs can access it.
4.  **Configure Other VMs to Use DHCP**:
    1.  Edit the settings of the VMs that should use DHCP.
    2.  Under the "Network Adapter" settings, ensure the adapter is connected to the same network as the DHCP server VM.
    3.  Within the guest operating system of each VM, configure the network settings to obtain an IP address automatically (using DHCP).

## Summary

-   **External DHCP Server**: Ensure VMs and the ESXi host network configuration allows communication with the external DHCP server.
-   **Virtual DHCP Server**: Set up a dedicated VM as a DHCP server within your ESXi environment, configure it, and ensure other VMs can communicate with it.

Both methods rely on ensuring proper network configurations within ESXi to allow DHCP communication.
